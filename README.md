Predicting LinkedIn Post Reach Using Regression Neural Network

Project Overview
This project uses data from a SaaS platform for Employer Branding on LinkedIn. The dataset consists of CSV files, each representing all posts made by a single client (i.e., an instance of the platform). The goal is to predict the potential reach of a LinkedIn post based on variables that are under user control.

A regression neural network model was trained to estimate post reach using the following features:

✍️ Post copy (text)

🌐 Current network size

⏰ Post time

📄 Post type: ['LINK', 'NATIVE_GALLERY', 'VIDEO', 'NATIVE_FILE', 'TEXT', 'DOCUMENT']
